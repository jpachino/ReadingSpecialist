      <h1>What Our Clients Say</h1>

      <!-- Testimonial 1 -->
      <div class="testimonial">
        <p>Nechuma has worked with our daughter both in person and on Zoom for over two years. She uses proven systems and develops creative solutions to help our daughter learn to read. At the end of 1st grade, our daughter was diagnosed with dyslexia and ADHD and because of the strong relationship that she developed with Nechuma, she was able to develop the early skills to decode words and become a confident learner. Nechuma makes learning fun and our daughter is enthusiastic about the progress that she makes each week. We can't recommend her enough!

        <p>"My name is Sari Hamway, my daughter Terri Lynne worked with Nechama for 2 years. She is amazing she literally taught my daughter how to read.  Nechama is patient, kind and encouraging. Nechama always brings 150 percent to the table at all times. Whether it’s reading with my daughter, helping her with homework, following up with all her teachers, making sure everyone was on the same page or even making little reading booklets for my daughter. Not once did Terri Lynne ever say ,,, I don’t want to work with Nechama now. Terri Lynne was always happy and willing to work with her, which says a lot because my daughter is not easy. Nechama came to my home twice a week . She was always prompt, always showed ..you could always count on her. I can gladly say that my daughter loves to read and I can 100 percent tell you that it was because of Nechama."
